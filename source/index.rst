Welcome to Rootshelf's documentation!
================================
Rootshelf is a food online tenders publishing platform for public primary schools on Kenya. 
We have developed close working relationships with thousands of farmer based organisations, so that we can directly source information on their contracts that are not advertised in print media or company websites.
Our objective is to ensure that if a public tender is advertised anywhere we will have that information available for you on Rootshelf, so that you can be sure that you 'never miss an opportunity'.


Key functions to be performed by Rootshelf:
===========================================

* Schools Registration
* Online Food Tendering Process
* To help farmers receive information concerning tenders in due time
* Provide training on food supply chain system systems
